# ScatterBrain
Thoughts with headings


Purpose
--------

Sometimes when we just want to note down information in terms of headings and some content, we just want to write down the scattered thoughts into a file or something. This is a simple server with a very simple front end which allows the user to enter a heading and what does it mean. Simple as that. 


We start it small.

Run
-----

#### Development
* npm run dev - This command will start the webpack dev server which will put a watch on the jsx files.
* Rest same process as in production.

#### Production
* go get -v 
* go build
* ./scatter-brain

Endpoints
